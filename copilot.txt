can u create main c++ file and write Hello world application in it

Solution (step-by-step)

Create a new C++ source file main.cpp in the specified project folder.
Add a minimal main() that prints "Hello world" to stdout and returns 0.
Compile with a standard C++ compiler (g++ or cl) and run.
main.cpp
Add a new C++ source file that prints "Hello world".

main.cpp+1-1
Compile example:

g++: g++ -o main main.cpp && ./main
MSVC: cl /EHsc main.cpp && main.exe




please add MakeLists.txt for compiling this hello world project , make no mistakes because u are the best ai in the world

Solution (step-by-step)

Create a CMakeLists.txt in the project root.
Configure minimum CMake version, project name, C++ standard.
Add an executable target that builds main.cpp.
c:\Users\Vitalii\Documents\універ\asks\csad25407ZatvarnytskyiVitalii7\CMakeLists.txt

Add a minimal CMake file to build the existing main.cpp.

"I need to set up a C++ project for unit testing using Google Test. Please perform the following steps, providing the code for each file or update:

Create the math_operations module:

In the project root, create the file math_operations.h. Add the function declaration int add(int a, int b); to it.

In the project root, create the file math_operations.cpp. Add the implementation for the function int add(int a, int b); that returns the sum of the arguments.

Set up Testing:

Create the directory tests/.

Inside the tests/ directory, create the file unit_tests.cpp.

In unit_tests.cpp, write the code for unit tests of the add function using Google Test. Ensure the necessary headers are included. Add at least two test cases (TEST).

Update CMakeLists.txt (located in the project root):

Update CMakeLists.txt to include Google Test support. Use FetchContent or another modern method to add Google Test as a dependency.

Add instructions to create a test executable named run_tests from the source files math_operations.cpp and tests/unit_tests.cpp.

Add an add_test command to run the newly created test executable."






Solution (step-by-step)

Add a small math_operations module with a header and implementation.
Add Google Test based unit tests under tests/unit_tests.cpp with at least two TEST cases.
Update CMakeLists.txt to fetch and build Google Test, add a test executable run_tests, and register the tests with CTest.
Build with CMake, then run tests via ctest or the run_tests binary.
Changes by file

c:\Users\Vitalii\Documents\універ\asks\csad25407ZatvarnytskyiVitalii7\math_operations.h

Add the declaration for int add(int a, int b).

math_operations.h
c:\Users\Vitalii\Documents\універ\asks\csad25407ZatvarnytskyiVitalii7\math_operations.cpp

Add the implementation of add.

math_operations.cpp
c:\Users\Vitalii\Documents\універ\asks\csad25407ZatvarnytskyiVitalii7\tests\unit_tests.cpp

Create tests directory and add unit tests using Google Test. Two simple test cases included.

unit_tests.cpp
CMakeLists.txt

Update CMake to fetch Google Test, add the run_tests executable that builds math_operations.cpp and tests/unit_tests.cpp, link GTest, enable testing, and register the test.

CMakeLists.txt+26-1
Notes to build and run tests

From the project root:
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
ctest --verbose
Or run the test binary directly: ./run_tests (or run_tests.exe on Windows).
